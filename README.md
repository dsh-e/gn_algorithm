## gn_algoritm
The Girvan-Newman is used for community detection. 

## Overview:
The recursive divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm will be implemented. It requires networkx python library. 
The process will be shown through a graph visualisation, where in each step the max betweenness is calculated and, therefore, a particular edge is being removed. The cycle is repeated while the graph is connected.
